What began as a hobby has evolved into a true passion. Now a software developer with more than 5 years of experience, in her spare time, Susan volunteers as an organizer for both the [Calgary Software Crafters](https://www.meetup.com/Calgary-Software-Crafters/) and the [Software Developers of Calgary](https://www.meetup.com/software-developers-of-calgary/). Additionally, she actively contributes to the weekly mob programming sessions with [Approval Tests](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Python/blob/main/docs/Contribute.md).
