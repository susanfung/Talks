I am a dedicated software developer, with more than five years of experience in the world of coding. What began as a hobby has evolved into a true passion. In my spare time, I generously volunteer as an organizer for both the [Calgary Software Crafters](https://www.meetup.com/Calgary-Software-Crafters/) and the [Software Developers of Calgary](https://www.meetup.com/software-developers-of-calgary/). Additionally, I actively contribute to the weekly mob programming sessions with [Approval Tests](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Python/blob/main/docs/Contribute.md).
